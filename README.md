# Portfolio Resume
Welcome to my portfolio resume.
With this project you will be able to get to know a bit more about myself.

[This is the final result!](https://portfolio-resume.beatrizsabino.repl.co)

### Why I did this project
Now you may be thinking why did I do this portfolio resume when I could just have done a bigger portfolio or a tailored resume.
<br>
Well it's simple, the main intente with this porject was to learn about the Django framework.


## Deployment
After some research for an alterative hosting service to Heroku, I came across Replit.

This is the first time I'm deploying a project so I was looking for a solution that would have an easy deployment process and Replit was the answer I was seeking.

Another advantage of using Replit is that you can create a new repository with your project directly from their plaform.Also when you need to update your files and then  commit your changes, Replit makes the process easy with a push of a button.

I followed [this article](https://blog.replit.com/deploying-django) and in no time I had my porfolio up and running.
