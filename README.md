Welcome to my portfolio resume.
With this project you will be able to get to know a bit more about myself.

### Why I did this project
Now you may be thinking why did I do this portfolio resume when I could just have done a bigger portfolio or a tailored resume.
<br>
Well it's simple, the main intente with this porject was to learn about the Django framework.
<br>

## Deplyment
After some research for an alterative hosting service for Heroku, I came across Replit.
<br>
This is the first time I'm deploying a project so I was looking for a solution that would have an easy deployment process and Replit was the awnser I was looking for.
<br>
I followed [this article](https://blog.replit.com/deploying-django) and in no time I had my porfolio up and running.
